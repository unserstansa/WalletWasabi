NeumÃ¡tica prÃ¡ctica is a book written by Antonio Serrano Nicolas, a professor of industrial engineering and automation at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. The book is aimed at students and professionals who want to learn the basics of pneumatic systems and their applications in various fields. The book covers topics such as pneumatic components, circuits, logic, control, maintenance, and troubleshooting. The book also includes practical exercises and examples to reinforce the theoretical concepts.
 
The book is divided into 20 chapters, each one focusing on a specific aspect of pneumatic technology. The first chapter introduces the fundamentals of pneumatics, such as pressure, flow, force, work, and energy. The second chapter explains the properties and characteristics of compressed air, such as temperature, humidity, contamination, and quality. The third chapter describes the main components of a pneumatic system, such as compressors, filters, regulators, lubricators, valves, cylinders, motors, and actuators. The fourth chapter shows how to design and draw pneumatic circuits using symbols and diagrams. The fifth chapter presents the basic principles of pneumatic logic and control, such as Boolean algebra, truth tables, Karnaugh maps, and Grafcet. The sixth chapter illustrates some common pneumatic circuits and their applications, such as sequential control, speed control, pressure control, and position control. The seventh chapter introduces the concept of electro-pneumatics and explains how to use electrical components and devices to control pneumatic systems. The eighth chapter discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using PLCs (programmable logic controllers) to automate pneumatic processes. The ninth chapter provides some guidelines and tips for selecting and sizing pneumatic components according to the requirements and specifications of each application. The tenth chapter explains how to install and connect pneumatic components and systems using pipes, hoses, fittings, connectors, and accessories. The eleventh chapter describes the main causes and effects of pneumatic failures and faults, such as leaks, blockages, wear, corrosion, contamination, and vibration. The twelfth chapter teaches how to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on pneumatic systems using tools, instruments, methods, and procedures. The thirteenth chapter demonstrates how to troubleshoot and diagnose pneumatic problems using logical reasoning and systematic analysis. The fourteenth chapter reviews some safety rules and regulations for working with pneumatic systems and equipment. The fifteenth chapter explores some advanced topics in pneumatics, such as proportional control, servo-pneumatics, and vacuum technology. The sixteenth chapter presents some examples of pneumatic applications in different industrial sectors, such as automotive, packaging, textile, and robotics. The seventeenth chapter introduces some emerging trends and innovations in pneumatics, such as smart pneumatics, digital pneumatics, and green pneumatics. The eighteenth chapter compares pneumatics with other technologies, such as hydraulics, electrics, and mechanics, and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses. The nineteenth chapter summarizes the main concepts and skills learned throughout the book and provides some suggestions for further study and research. The twentieth chapter contains a glossary of terms and acronyms used in pneumatics and a list of references and resources for more information.
